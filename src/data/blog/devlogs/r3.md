  Nuclear's R3 release
---


# Hi again.

This one’s going to be a little different. Less wordy, hopefully. Just a little checkpoint on what Nuclear’s been up to over the past few weeks.

---

### R3 is on its way

We’re calling this next update the **R3 release** and it’s kind of a big deal.

Why? Because this is the one where we start cracking open the gates. Our alpha testing program is live (!!) and we’re slowly starting to bring new folks in. If you want to help shape the future of Nuclear (or just wanna break things and send us long rants), here’s your golden ticket:

[Fill this out to become an alpha tester](#)

We're starting small.

### A whole new UI

Somewhere between Figma and existential dread, we realized we were kinda doing too much. So we burned it all down (metaphorically) and rebuilt a new UI from scratch. Lighter. Simpler. Way more *human*.

Less “AI lab project,” more “hey, this could actually help me pass calc.”

(and thiis is just page 1/3)

We’re also actively looking for feedback here. If you’re someone who cares about good design and/or has strong feelings about buttons with weird shadows, contact us!

### Tech stuff

Okay, backend moment.

We quietly went in and *refactored* our core. Without giving away too many secrets, we introduced a **custom abstraction layer** between our database and the frontend.

What does that mean?

- Faster responses  
- Less spaghetti code  
- More flexibility for the cool stuff we’re planning    

It’s one of those changes no one sees, but everything feels better because of it.

### Listening mode: ON

We’ve been talking to a *lot* of people lately, students, friends, strangers on Reddit, startup mentors, even professors. It’s been clear: there’s a real gap in how learning tools are being built, and people are tired of tools that pretend to help but don’t.

We don’t want to build just another app. We want to build *the one* students actually want to use.

So we’re taking notes (on Nuclear, of course), refining our roadmap, and staying painfully honest about what works and what doesn’t.

---

### Something new is cooking...

We’re working on a new feature that might just be *very* cool. Like, “why doesn’t this exist already?” cool. Can’t say much yet (mostly because it’s still duct-taped together), but maybe next devlog.

### Wordle

Still going strong with a 37-day streak. Still haven’t learned how to shut up about it. That’s the update.

---

That’s all for now.  

Thanks for being here,
