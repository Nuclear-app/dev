Nuclear is a note-taking app that actually wants you to learn, not just copy-paste your way through lectures. Instead of dumping summaries and quizzes on you, we give you structured notes that unlock as you prove your understanding. 

Built by students who were tired of surface-level AI tools, Nuclear adapts to how you study, whether you like filling in the blanks, freestyling with LaTeX, or just want your notes to look clean without doing all the work.

Currently building our MVP under McGill's TechAccel program. Launching soon...



## Tech Stack

Nuclear is built on Next.Js and Supabase. With a sprinkle of figma.
